Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm diving headfirst into a 100-day JavaScript adventure, and I couldn't be more thrilled to share it with you all! ðŸŽ‰

Over the next three months, I'll be immersing myself in everything JavaScript has to offer, from the very basics to some seriously advanced concepts. Here's a sneak peek into what's in store:

**Exploring JavaScript Fundamentals:**
- [Code structure](https://github.com/lassiecoder/100daysofjs/tree/code-structure-and-modern-mode)
